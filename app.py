
# The app that will guide students in choosing a career path based on their skills. The app uses a simple k-nearest neighbors (KNN) model to recommend careers based on the user's skill ratings. The user can rate their skills in programming, math, communication, Big Data, Finance, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Geography, History, English, Ethics, and Empathy. The app then uses the KNN model to find the most similar careers based on the user's skill ratings and recommends them to the user.
